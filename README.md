# Subdomain Modifier

This Go script modifies a list of subdomains by removing the "http://" prefix and replacing it with "https://". The modified subdomains are then saved to a new file.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/subdomain-modifier.git
